## Scoring Breakdown

| Element | Points | Max | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Title | 5 | 5 | Clear, descriptive: "Modern Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery: Clinical Practice, Technology, and Practice Management for the Full-Scope OMS Surgeon" |
| Target Audience | 5 | 5 | Precisely defined: practicing, board-certified OMS surgeon in the US with specific needs listed |
| Prerequisites | 5 | 5 | DDS/DMD, OMS residency, ABOMS certification/eligibility, CBCT familiarity |
| Main Topics Covered | 10 | 10 | 20 chapters across 6 parts covering clinical, technology, operations, and frontiers |
| Topics Excluded | 3 | 5 | No explicit exclusions section; scope is implicitly clear but could be made explicit |
| Learning Outcomes Header | 5 | 5 | Full Bloom's Taxonomy alignment with clear "Learning Outcomes" section |
| Remember Level | 10 | 10 | 5 specific outcomes with precise action verbs (recall, list, name, identify) |
| Understand Level | 10 | 10 | 5 specific outcomes (explain, describe, summarize, differentiate, interpret) |
| Apply Level | 10 | 10 | 5 specific outcomes (select, configure, apply, perform, implement) |
| Analyze Level | 10 | 10 | 5 specific outcomes (compare, analyze, differentiate, evaluate, assess) |
| Evaluate Level | 10 | 10 | 5 specific outcomes (critique, judge, assess, evaluate, determine) |
| Create Level | 10 | 10 | 5 specific outcomes (design, develop, construct, propose, build) |
| Descriptive Context | 3 | 5 | Strong design principles and architecture sections; could add more on clinical importance |

## Strengths

- Exceptionally comprehensive scope covering all 11 AAOMS ParCare clinical areas
- Strong technology coverage including specific product names (Yomi, Brainlab, KLS Martin)
- Practice operations pillar is unusual and highly valuable for practitioners
- Explicit source citation requirements and verifiability framework
- Bloom's Taxonomy outcomes are specific, measurable, and clinically relevant

## Areas for Enhancement

- Could explicitly state what topics are excluded (e.g., general dentistry, pediatric dentistry non-craniofacial)
- Could add estimated concept count per chapter for better balance planning
- Data gaps section is excellent but could be prioritized

## Recommendation

**Proceed with learning graph generation.** This course description exceeds quality thresholds with a score of 96/100.
