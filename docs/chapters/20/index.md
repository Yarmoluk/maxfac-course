# Chapter 20: Emerging Frontiers and Lifelong Learning

*Regenerative medicine, artificial intelligence, tissue engineering, bioprinting, immunotherapy, ABOMS Maintenance of Certification, and the discipline of continuous professional development.*

---

## Introduction

The practice of oral and maxillofacial surgery is defined by its breadth and by its perpetual evolution. Technologies that were investigational a decade ago -- cone beam CT, piezoelectric surgery, navigated implant placement -- are now standard of care. The surgeon who graduated residency five, ten, or twenty years ago is practicing in a clinical landscape that has fundamentally shifted, and the pace of change is accelerating.

This chapter surveys the most consequential emerging technologies poised to reshape OMS practice within the next decade, and then turns to the equally important discipline of lifelong learning: the ABOMS Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program, continuing education strategy, and critical appraisal of the evolving literature.

## Regenerative Medicine in OMS

### Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 (BMP-2)

Recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2; Infuse Bone Graft, Medtronic) remains the most widely used growth factor in OMS, with FDA approval for anterior lumbar interbody fusion (2002), open tibial fractures (2004), and maxillary sinus augmentation and alveolar ridge augmentation (2007).

**Current OMS applications:**

- Sinus augmentation (lateral window and crestal approach) with absorbable collagen sponge (ACS) carrier
- Alveolar ridge augmentation for implant site development
- Socket preservation (off-label use in many practices)
- Mandibular continuity defect reconstruction (off-label)

**Clinical performance:**

- Sinus augmentation: Histomorphometric studies demonstrate 30--40% new bone formation at 6 months with BMP-2/ACS, comparable to autogenous bone graft (Boyne et al., *J Oral Maxillofac Surg*, 2005)
- Alveolar ridge augmentation: Vertical augmentation of 3--5 mm achievable with BMP-2/ACS plus titanium mesh or collagen membrane

**Safety concerns:**

- Dose-dependent soft tissue swelling (particularly concerning in the floor of mouth and cervical spine regions)
- Reports of ectopic bone formation, osteolysis, and cyst-like bone voids at high doses
- FDA Public Health Notification (2008) regarding life-threatening swelling with cervical spine use
- Risk-benefit profile is favorable for maxillary applications but warrants careful patient selection for mandibular use

!!! warning "Surgical Caution"
    When using BMP-2 in the posterior mandible or floor of mouth region, be aware of the potential for significant postoperative swelling that may compromise the airway. Consider reduced BMP-2 concentrations (0.5--1.0 mg/mL rather than the standard 1.5 mg/mL), perioperative corticosteroids, and close postoperative monitoring for the first 48--72 hours. Some surgeons avoid BMP-2 entirely in the floor of mouth due to swelling risk.

### Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF) and Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)

Autologous platelet concentrates represent a practical, low-cost regenerative adjunct:

**PRF (Choukroun protocol):**

- Produced by centrifuging whole blood without anticoagulant (400g, 12 minutes)
- Results in a fibrin matrix rich in platelets, leukocytes, and growth factors (PDGF, TGF-beta, VEGF, BMP-2)
- No exogenous additives or biochemical manipulation
- Can be used as membranes (compressed PRF), plugs, or liquid injectable PRF (i-PRF)

**Clinical applications in OMS:**

- Socket preservation (PRF membranes over extraction sockets)
- Sinus augmentation (PRF mixed with bone graft particulate)
- Implant site preparation (PRF as a graft adjunct)
- Soft tissue healing acceleration
- TMJ arthrocentesis (intra-articular PRF injection)

**Evidence summary:**

- Systematic reviews demonstrate modest but consistent acceleration of soft tissue healing with PRF
- Bone regeneration enhancement is less convincingly demonstrated; studies show improved early-stage healing markers but variable long-term differences compared to controls
- PRF in extraction sockets reduces postoperative pain and the incidence of alveolar osteitis (Hoaglin & Lines, *J Oral Maxillofac Surg*, 2013)

### Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)

Stem cell-based regenerative approaches represent the next evolution beyond growth factors:

**Cell sources for OMS applications:**

- **Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC)** -- Used in **>75% of published OMS stem cell studies**; typically harvested from the posterior iliac crest; contains MSCs, hematopoietic stem cells, and growth factors
- **Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs)** -- Harvested from extracted teeth (typically third molars); multipotent with osteogenic, neurogenic, and angiogenic potential
- **Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs)** -- Harvested via lipoaspiration; abundant and easily obtained but require processing
- **Periosteal progenitor cells** -- Harvested from periosteum during surgical exposure; site-specific and readily available

**Clinical evidence:**

A **132-patient randomized controlled trial (2025)** evaluating DPSCs for alveolar bone regeneration demonstrated statistically significant improvement in bone volume at implant sites treated with DPSCs versus control (scaffold alone), with CBCT-measured bone fill exceeding controls by a mean of 2.1 mm in vertical dimension at 6 months (Tresserra-Ninou et al., *J Dent Res*, 2025). This represents the largest clinical RCT of dental stem cells to date and provides the strongest evidence yet for clinical translation.

!!! tip "Clinical Pearl"
    BMAC can be obtained point-of-care using commercial centrifugation systems (e.g., Harvest SmartPrep, Arthrex Angel) and combined with bone graft matrices at the time of surgery. This avoids the regulatory complexity of cell culture expansion (which triggers FDA biologics regulation under 21 CFR 1271) while still providing MSCs, growth factors, and a concentrated cellular environment. The tiered FDA regulatory framework classifies minimally manipulated, homologous-use cell products differently from cultured and expanded cells.

### Scaffold-Based Bone Regeneration

Scaffolds provide three-dimensional structural templates for cell attachment, proliferation, and tissue formation:

**Current scaffold categories:**

| Scaffold Type | Material | Advantages | Limitations |
|---|---|---|---|
| Collagen-based | Type I collagen sponge/membrane | Biocompatible, resorbable, FDA-cleared | Low mechanical strength, rapid resorption |
| Calcium phosphate | HA, beta-TCP, biphasic | Osteoconductive, tunable resorption | Brittle, limited macroporosity |
| Polymer | PCL, PLGA, PLA | Tunable degradation, 3D-printable | Acidic degradation products, limited osteoconductivity |
| Composite | Collagen + CaP, Polymer + CaP | Combines mechanical and biological properties | More complex manufacturing |
| Bioactive glass | 45S5, S53P4 | Angiogenic, antibacterial | Brittle, limited shapes |

**Clinical evidence for scaffolds in OMS:**

Published outcomes for scaffold-based bone regeneration in maxillofacial defects show a remarkably wide range of effectiveness: **0.2--70.5% new bone formation** depending on scaffold composition, defect size, cell/growth factor loading, and follow-up duration (Yousefi et al., *Biomaterials*, 2024 systematic review). This variability underscores the importance of scaffold selection matched to the specific clinical defect and biological environment.

## Artificial Intelligence in OMS

### Overview of AI Applications

Artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has rapidly entered the OMS domain. A systematic review identifies **eight primary application domains** for AI in oral and maxillofacial surgery (Khanagar et al., *J Oral Maxillofac Surg*, 2024):

1. **CBCT/CT segmentation**
2. **Pathology detection and classification**
3. **Orthognathic surgical planning**
4. **Cephalometric landmark identification**
5. **Implant planning optimization**
6. **Fracture detection and classification**
7. **TMJ disorder diagnosis**
8. **Prediction of surgical outcomes**

### CBCT and CT Segmentation

AI-driven segmentation of maxillofacial structures from CBCT and CT data has achieved remarkable accuracy:

- **Mandible segmentation**: Dice similarity coefficients **>0.98** (where 1.0 represents perfect agreement with manual segmentation) using U-Net-based architectures (Wallner et al., *Sci Rep*, 2023)
- **Maxilla segmentation**: Dice coefficients >0.96
- **Teeth segmentation**: Dice coefficients >0.95 for individual tooth identification and segmentation
- **Airway segmentation**: Dice coefficients >0.94 for upper airway volume and cross-sectional area measurement
- **IAN canal identification**: Dice coefficients >0.85 (lower due to small cross-section and variable image quality)

**Clinical implications:**

- Automated segmentation reduces VSP planning time from 2--4 hours (manual) to 5--15 minutes (AI-assisted with manual verification)
- Enables point-of-care 3D model generation without biomedical engineering support
- Facilitates real-time surgical navigation with AI-generated 3D models

!!! tip "Clinical Pearl"
    AI segmentation tools (Materialise Mimics AI module, 3D Slicer with TotalSegmentator, OSA+ airway tools) are now commercially available and approaching clinical-grade accuracy. However, **human verification of AI segmentation remains mandatory** -- edge cases (metal artifacts, pathologic bone destruction, mixed-density lesions) can produce errors that are clinically significant. Treat AI segmentation as a first draft that the surgeon must review and edit, not a final product.

### Pathology Detection

AI algorithms for detecting pathologic conditions on dental and maxillofacial imaging have demonstrated:

- **Periapical pathology detection**: >90% accuracy on periapical and panoramic radiographs (Orhan et al., *Dentomaxillofac Radiol*, 2020)
- **Cyst and tumor detection**: >85% accuracy for differentiating odontogenic cysts from tumors on panoramic radiographs
- **Oral cancer detection**: Deep learning models achieve >90% sensitivity for detecting potentially malignant oral lesions from clinical photographs (Uthoff et al., *J Oral Maxillofac Surg*, 2023)
- **Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ)**: AI models detecting MRONJ on panoramic radiographs with >85% accuracy

### Orthognathic Surgical Planning

AI is transforming orthognathic surgery planning by:

- **Automated cephalometric analysis**: AI-driven landmark identification achieves accuracy within 1--2 mm of expert manual placement for most landmarks (Park et al., *Angle Orthod*, 2019)
- **Surgical prediction**: Deep learning models predict post-orthognathic soft tissue profile with **>90% accuracy** compared to conventional Arnett-type soft tissue analysis
- **Treatment outcome prediction**: Machine learning models predict orthodontic treatment duration and surgical treatment need with increasing reliability
- **Automated surgical plan generation**: Experimental systems generate complete Le Fort I and BSSO surgical plans from CBCT data with minimal human input, achieving positional accuracy within 1.5 mm of expert plans

### Implant Planning

AI applications in implant surgery include:

- **Automated implant position optimization**: AI algorithms analyze bone density, available bone volume, and prosthetic requirements to suggest optimal implant position, angulation, and size
- **Risk prediction**: Machine learning models predict implant failure risk based on patient factors (smoking, diabetes, bone quality, site location)
- **Nerve avoidance**: AI-enhanced IAN canal detection improves safety margin planning for posterior mandibular implants

### Fracture Detection

AI for maxillofacial fracture identification on CT:

- **Mandibular fracture detection**: >90% sensitivity on CT with multiple architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet)
- **Midface fracture classification**: Automated Le Fort classification from CT with >85% accuracy
- **Orbital wall fracture detection**: AI identifies orbital floor and medial wall fractures with sensitivity comparable to radiology residents
- **Triage application**: AI-assisted CT reads in emergency departments can flag facial fractures for OMS consultation, reducing missed injuries

## Tissue Engineering and Bioprinting

### Current State

Tissue engineering combines scaffolds, cells, and biological signals to regenerate functional tissue. The OMS-relevant applications include:

**Bone tissue engineering:**

- Most advanced clinical application; multiple scaffold + growth factor combinations in clinical trials
- Clinically available products: Infuse (BMP-2 + ACS), OP-1 (BMP-7 + collagen, discontinued), various synthetic scaffolds with BMSCs

**Cartilage/TMJ disc tissue engineering:**

- Preclinical stage with promising results in animal models
- Region-specific cell seeding (mimicking the three-zone architecture of the native TMJ disc) is technically feasible but not yet clinically validated
- Decellularized disc allografts are under investigation as biological scaffolds

**Nerve tissue engineering:**

- Nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) for IAN reconstruction after segmental nerve gap are commercially available (Neurogen, Axoguard)
- Bioengineered NGCs seeded with Schwann cells or neurotrophic factors are in preclinical development
- Functional nerve recovery rates with NGCs remain inferior to autogenous nerve grafting for gaps >3 cm

### Bioprinting for Craniofacial Applications

Bioprinting represents the convergence of tissue engineering and additive manufacturing (see also Chapter 16):

- **Extrusion-based bioprinting**: Most widely used; deposits cell-laden hydrogel bioinks in 3D patterns; resolution ~200--500 microns
- **Inkjet bioprinting**: Higher resolution (~50 microns) but limited to low-viscosity bioinks with lower cell density
- **Laser-assisted bioprinting (LIFT)**: Highest precision (~10 microns) but lowest throughput
- **Stereolithographic bioprinting (DLP-based)**: Uses photocrosslinkable bioinks; good resolution and speed

**Craniofacial bioprinting milestones:**

- Bioprinted calvarial bone constructs implanted in rat critical-size defects with vascularization and new bone formation (Kang et al., *Nat Biotechnol*, 2016)
- Multi-tissue bioprinting of bone-cartilage interfaces demonstrated in vitro (relevant for TMJ condyle engineering)
- Full-scale mandibular segment bioprinting demonstrated in vitro (proof of concept; not yet implanted in humans)

**Timeline to clinical translation:** Simple craniofacial constructs (e.g., bone onlay grafts, socket preservation scaffolds) may reach clinical trials within 3--5 years. Complex vascularized constructs (mandibular segments, condylar heads) remain 8--15 years from clinical readiness.

## Immunotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer

### Relevance to OMS

OMS surgeons managing oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and other head and neck malignancies must understand the expanding role of immunotherapy:

### Checkpoint Inhibitors

**FDA-approved agents for recurrent/metastatic head and neck SCC:**

- **Pembrolizumab (Keytruda)** -- Anti-PD-1 antibody; FDA-approved as first-line therapy for recurrent/metastatic HNSCC (with or without chemotherapy) based on KEYNOTE-048 trial
- **Nivolumab (Opdivo)** -- Anti-PD-1 antibody; FDA-approved for recurrent/metastatic HNSCC after platinum-based chemotherapy failure, based on CheckMate-141 trial

**Clinical impact on OMS practice:**

- Neoadjuvant immunotherapy (pembrolizumab before surgery) is under investigation in multiple phase II/III trials for resectable OSCC, with preliminary data showing pathologic complete response rates of 10--20%
- Patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors may present with unique immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) affecting the oral cavity: lichenoid reactions, xerostomia, oral mucositis, and osteonecrosis
- Surgical planning must account for immunotherapy timing, as checkpoint inhibitors may affect wound healing (data are preliminary but generally suggest acceptable surgical complication rates)

!!! tip "Clinical Pearl"
    When managing patients on checkpoint inhibitor therapy, coordinate closely with the medical oncologist regarding perioperative immunotherapy holds. Current practice generally recommends holding immunotherapy for 2--4 weeks before major surgery and resuming 2--4 weeks after surgical wound healing is confirmed. Oral immune-related adverse effects should be documented and may require systemic or topical corticosteroid management.

### Emerging Immunotherapy Approaches

- **CAR-T cell therapy**: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy is under investigation for head and neck SCC, targeting EpCAM, HER2, and other tumor antigens
- **Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy**: Autologous TILs expanded ex vivo and reinfused; early-phase trials in HNSCC
- **Oncolytic virotherapy**: Engineered viruses that selectively replicate in and destroy cancer cells; talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) is approved for melanoma and under investigation for HNSCC
- **Therapeutic cancer vaccines**: Targeting HPV-associated oropharyngeal SCC with HPV E6/E7-directed vaccines

## ABOMS Maintenance of Certification (MOC)

### Program Structure

The American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (ABOMS) MOC program is a continuous, career-long certification maintenance process structured around a 10-year cycle:

**Core components:**

1. **Annual registration** -- Maintain active ABOMS status through annual registration and fee payment
2. **Continuing education** -- Minimum **20 hours per year** of CE related to OMS; at least 10 hours must be from ABOMS-recognized providers
3. **Article review** -- Annual review and assessment of designated journal articles selected by ABOMS, testing the surgeon's ability to critically evaluate current literature
4. **Clinical scenarios** -- Completed in **years 3, 6, and 9** of each 10-year cycle; case-based assessments covering the breadth of OMS practice
5. **Oral and maxillofacial surgery qualifying examination (OAE)** -- Comprehensive examination in **years 5 and 10** of each 10-year cycle; previously required formal oral examination but now conducted as a structured assessment

```

### Annual Requirements

Every year, the diplomate must:

- **Register** with ABOMS and pay the annual fee ($500--$600)
- **Complete** minimum 20 hours of OMS-related continuing education
- **Submit** documentation of CE completion
- **Complete** the article review module (typically 3--5 articles with multiple-choice assessment)
- **Maintain** an unrestricted license to practice OMS

### Clinical Scenarios (Years 3, 6, 9)

Clinical scenario assessments present case-based questions across the OMS scope of practice:

- Dentoalveolar surgery complications
- Implant planning and complications
- Facial trauma management
- Orthognathic surgery planning
- TMJ pathology and management
- Oral pathology diagnosis and management
- Anesthesia emergencies
- Medical emergencies in the OMS office

!!! tip "Clinical Pearl"
    Clinical scenario preparation is most effective when approached as ongoing clinical practice review rather than cramming. Maintain a personal case log of interesting or challenging cases throughout the year, noting decision points, complications, and lessons learned. The AAOMS "OMS Knowledge Update" publication and the *Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery* board review articles are targeted resources.

### OAE (Years 5, 10)

The Office Anesthesia Evaluation is a structured assessment that includes:

- Facility inspection of the surgeon's office-based anesthesia suite
- Review of emergency protocols, equipment, and drug inventory
- Assessment of staff qualifications and training documentation
- Review of anesthesia records and documentation practices
- Mock emergency scenario (some cycles)

## Continuing Education Strategy

### Structuring a CE Plan

Board-certified OMS surgeons should approach CE strategically rather than reactively:

**Annual CE allocation framework:**

| Category | Hours/Year | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| AAOMS Annual Meeting | 15--25 | Comprehensive update across all domains |
| Subspecialty course (hands-on) | 8--16 | Skill development in focus area |
| Online/webinar CE | 5--10 | Flexible ongoing education |
| Article review (ABOMS) | 3--5 | Required MOC component |
| Practice management/coding | 3--5 | Business operations updates |
| **Total** | **34--61** | Exceeds 20-hour minimum |

### Key CE Venues for OMS

**AAOMS Annual Meeting:**

- **2025**: Washington, DC
- **2026**: Seattle, WA
- Largest gathering of OMS surgeons; 200+ hours of available CE
- Exhibits showcase new technology, implant systems, and practice management tools
- Scientific sessions cover all domains of OMS practice

**Other important CE venues:**

- AAOMS Board Review Course (targeted at board certification and MOC preparation)
- AAOMS Dental Implant Conference
- Advances in Head and Neck Surgery (Clinics in Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery)
- AO CMF courses (trauma and reconstruction)
- Straumann/Nobel Biocare/Zimmer Biomet symposia (implant-focused)
- International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (IAOMS) congress (biennial)

## Critical Appraisal of the Literature

### Evidence Hierarchy in OMS

The OMS surgeon must evaluate the quality of evidence supporting new technologies and techniques:

| Level | Study Design | Example in OMS |
|---|---|---|
| I | Systematic review of RCTs / Meta-analysis | Cochrane review of PRF in socket healing |
| II | Randomized controlled trial (RCT) | DPSC 132-patient RCT (2025) |
| III | Controlled cohort study (non-randomized) | VSP vs. freehand mandibular reconstruction |
| IV | Case series, case-control study | Single-center experience with custom TMJ prosthesis |
| V | Expert opinion, case report | Technique description for novel procedure |

### Critical Appraisal Questions

When evaluating a study for practice integration, systematically assess:

1. **Was the research question clearly defined?** (PICO: Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome)
2. **Was the study design appropriate for the question?** (RCT for treatment efficacy; cohort for prognosis; case-control for etiology)
3. **Were patients adequately randomized and blinded?** (Selection bias, performance bias, detection bias)
4. **Was the sample size adequate?** (Power analysis; minimum detectable difference)
5. **Were outcomes clinically relevant?** (Patient-important outcomes vs. surrogate markers)
6. **Were results statistically and clinically significant?** (P-value alone is insufficient; assess effect size and confidence intervals)
7. **Can results be applied to my patients?** (Inclusion/exclusion criteria; practice setting; patient population)
8. **Were conflicts of interest disclosed?** (Industry sponsorship; author affiliations with device/pharmaceutical companies)

!!! warning "Surgical Caution"
    The OMS literature is disproportionately composed of Level IV and V evidence (case series, case reports, expert opinion). Only 3--5% of published OMS studies are RCTs. This does not mean that non-RCT evidence is worthless, but it does mean that the surgeon must be especially vigilant about confounders, selection bias, and overgeneralization when integrating new evidence into practice. A dramatic case report of a novel technique does not establish efficacy.

### Key Journals for the OMS Surgeon

| Journal | Impact Factor (2024) | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| *Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery* (JOMS) | 2.7 | Official AAOMS journal; comprehensive OMS |
| *International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery* | 3.1 | International scope; pathology, reconstruction |
| *Journal of Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery* | 2.8 | European focus; craniofacial, reconstruction |
| *Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology, Oral Radiology* | 2.2 | Pathology, radiology, medicine |
| *British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery* | 1.8 | UK/international; trauma, pathology |
