Every answer should be verifiable and have something to track back to. If you are missing data to be useful,   identify it and acquire it or tell me to as a way to refine. I only want pictures if they are very relevant. I want a modern   practice environment where the surgeon and billing and running an office is all part of the practice. refine this prompt to be   leading in field today.  </p>"}]}
