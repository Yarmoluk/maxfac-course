## Course Overview

This intelligent textbook serves as a comprehensive, AI-queryable knowledge base for a practicing OMS surgeon. Unlike traditional textbooks that are read linearly, this reference is optimized for on-demand retrieval: the surgeon asks a question at any time from any device, and receives a verifiable, source-cited answer.

The content is organized around five pillars:

1. **Clinical Surgery** - Evidence-based procedural knowledge across all OMS subspecialties, aligned to AAOMS Parameters of Care 2023 (ParCare)
2. **Surgical Technology** - Robotic systems, navigation platforms, 3D printing/VSP, AI diagnostics, and instrumentation
3. **Practice Operations** - Billing, coding, insurance, compliance, EHR systems, staffing, and financial management
4. **Patient Lifecycle** - From referral through consultation, surgical planning, informed consent, procedure, recovery, and follow-up including telemedicine
5. **Professional Development** - ABOMS MOC requirements, CE tracking, medicolegal risk, and emerging frontiers

### Design Principles

- **Every answer is verifiable.** All clinical content cites AAOMS ParCare sections, peer-reviewed literature (JOMS, IJOMS, OOO), FDA clearance numbers, or CPT/CDT/ICD-10 code references. No unsourced claims.
- **Mobile-first.** Responsive design tested on phone screens. The chatbot interface is the primary interaction mode.
- **Activity monitoring.** Usage analytics track what questions are asked, response quality ratings, topic frequency, and knowledge gaps to continuously refine content.
- **Minimal images, maximum utility.** Images included only for: surgical anatomy where text is insufficient, instrument identification, and radiographic interpretation. No decorative imagery.
- **Living document.** Content versioned and updatable as guidelines, codes, and technology change (annual CPT/CDT updates, new FDA clearances, ParCare revisions).
