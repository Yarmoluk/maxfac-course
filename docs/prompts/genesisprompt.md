write an intelligent textbook about maxiofacial surgery for a practicing surgeon in this domain. I want the intelligent textbook 
  to include a robust learning graph with all modern robotics and surgical instruments. The purpose is for the surgeon to ask       
  whatever questions he wants to ask at anytime. I would like him to be able to probe this on his phone. I want to monitor activity 
  and responsiveness. Every answer should be verifiable and have something to track back to. If you are missing data to be useful,
  identify it and acquire it or tell me to as a way to refine. I only want pictures if they are very relevant. I want a modern
  practice environment where the surgeon and billing and running an office is all part of the practice. refine this prompt to be
  leading in field today.
