**Alveoloplasty**: Surgical reshaping of the alveolar ridge to create a smooth contour for prosthetic rehabilitation.

**Arthrocentesis**: Minimally invasive lavage of the temporomandibular joint space using needle puncture and irrigation.

**Arthroscopy**: Endoscopic examination and treatment of the temporomandibular joint through a small-diameter scope.

**Bilateral Sagittal Split Osteotomy (BSSO)**: Mandibular osteotomy technique that splits the ramus sagittally to reposition the distal segment for correction of mandibular deformities.

**BMP-2 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2)**: Recombinant growth factor (rhBMP-2) used to stimulate osteoinduction in bone graft procedures.

**CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography)**: Volumetric imaging technique that produces three-dimensional radiographic data of the maxillofacial skeleton using a cone-shaped X-ray beam.

**CDT (Current Dental Terminology)**: Standardized code set maintained by the ADA for reporting dental procedures to insurance carriers.

**Condylar Fracture**: Fracture of the mandibular condyle, classified by location (intracapsular, subcondylar, condylar neck) and displacement.

**CPT (Current Procedural Terminology)**: Standardized code set maintained by the AMA for reporting medical procedures and services to insurance carriers.

**Cross-Coding**: The process of translating dental CDT procedures to medical CPT codes for submission to medical insurance payers.

**DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)**: International standard for transmitting, storing, and sharing medical imaging data.

**Distraction Osteogenesis**: Surgical technique that generates new bone between two bone segments that are gradually separated by incremental traction.

**DOME Procedure**: Distraction osteogenesis maxillary expansion, a surgically assisted technique for maxillary widening in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.

**DPSC (Dental Pulp Stem Cell)**: Mesenchymal stem cells derived from dental pulp tissue with osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation capacity.

**ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery)**: Multimodal perioperative care protocol designed to minimize physiological stress and accelerate recovery.

**Fiducial Marker**: Radio-opaque reference point placed on the patient for registration between preoperative imaging and intraoperative navigation.

**Free Flap**: Composite tissue transfer in which a segment of tissue with its vascular pedicle is harvested and microsurgically anastomosed to recipient vessels at the defect site.

**Genioplasty**: Osteotomy of the chin segment (genial bone) to reposition it for functional or aesthetic correction.

**Guided Surgery**: Implant or osteotomy placement using a stereolithographic surgical guide fabricated from virtual planning data.

**Haptic Guidance**: Force feedback technology in robotic surgical systems that provides tactile resistance to constrain instrument movement within a planned surgical volume.

**ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision)**: Standardized diagnostic coding system used for medical billing and epidemiological tracking.

**IPS CaseDesigner**: KLS Martin's virtual surgical planning software for orthognathic and craniomaxillofacial procedures.

**LeFort I Osteotomy**: Horizontal osteotomy of the maxilla at the level of the nasal floor, allowing repositioning of the entire upper jaw.

**Maxillomandibular Advancement (MMA)**: Combined LeFort I and BSSO to advance the maxilla and mandible for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.

**MRONJ (Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw)**: Exposed or probeable bone in the maxillofacial region persisting for more than 8 weeks in a patient exposed to antiresorptive or antiangiogenic agents, without history of radiation.

**Navigation-Guided Surgery**: Intraoperative use of computer-assisted tracking systems to correlate surgical instrument position with preoperative imaging in real time.

**Orthognathic Surgery**: Surgical repositioning of the maxilla, mandible, or both to correct dentofacial deformities and malocclusion.

**Panfacial Fracture**: Simultaneous fractures involving the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the facial skeleton.

**ParCare (Parameters of Care)**: AAOMS clinical practice guidelines defining therapeutic goals, risk factors, and outcomes for 11 areas of OMS practice.

**Patient-Specific Implant (PSI)**: Custom-manufactured titanium or PEEK implant designed from the patient's CT data for precise anatomic reconstruction.

**Piezoelectric Surgery**: Ultrasonic bone-cutting technique using microvibrations that selectively cut mineralized tissue while preserving soft tissue structures.

**PRF (Platelet-Rich Fibrin)**: Autologous blood concentrate obtained by centrifugation without anticoagulant, containing a fibrin matrix with platelets and growth factors.

**PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma)**: Autologous blood concentrate with a high platelet count obtained by centrifugation, used to deliver growth factors to surgical sites.

**Rigid Fixation**: Stabilization of bone fragments using titanium plates and screws to achieve primary bone healing without intermaxillary fixation.

**SARPE (Surgically Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion)**: Surgical procedure to facilitate maxillary expansion in skeletally mature patients by osteotomizing the lateral maxillary walls and midpalatal suture.

**Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy**: Surgical identification and removal of the first lymph node(s) draining a primary tumor site to assess for metastatic disease.

**Total Joint Replacement (TMJ)**: Prosthetic replacement of the mandibular condyle and/or temporal fossa component with alloplastic materials.

**TORS (Transoral Robotic Surgery)**: Minimally invasive surgical approach using robotic-assisted instruments introduced through the oral cavity for resection of oropharyngeal and laryngeal pathology.

**Virtual Surgical Planning (VSP)**: Computer-based 3D simulation of surgical osteotomies and repositioning performed on the patient's CT data prior to surgery.

**Yomi**: FDA-cleared robotic system by Neocis that provides haptic-guided assistance for dental implant placement.

**ZMC Fracture (Zygomaticomaxillary Complex)**: Fracture involving the zygoma and its articulations with the frontal, temporal, sphenoid, and maxillary bones.
